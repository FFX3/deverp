Goal: create an ERP built for developers, I'll be it's first user

Business model: The software will be open source, I'll charge clients for installation and consultation while migrating to this platform upfront, and I'll charge on-going for a SLA and server maintenace. I can also charge to build new "apps" that will be added to the project.

Advantages:
    - No vendor lock
    - Extensible
    - No third party servers or access
    - Tailor made for developers
    - Access to founding team to help add features

What makes this ERP tailor made:
    - no manufacturing module
    - Service level agreement module that interacts with the "Help desk"
    - Help desk
    - Feature that help search for jobs on Upwork
    - Integration with github, send help desk items to github as an issue
    - Integration with digital ocean to notify user of the ERP about server health issues
    - password management
    - feature to facilitate working with other contractors
